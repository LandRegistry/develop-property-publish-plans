# I want to develop land or property - Alpha for 'sharing estate plans'

This is prototyping the beta proposition. 

Not just stuff for end users.  Also includes stuff for internal, organisational use.


## Related protoypes

This protoype, and alpha, is based on the work in the previous, wider scoped alpha.

This, new, proto, will take a more focused view, and will bring across work from wider looking - (develop land and proprty alpha protoype)[https://github.com/LandRegistry/develop-property-alpha]

## About the GOV.UK protoype kit

### GOV.UK Prototype Kit Â· [![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/alphagov/govuk-prototype-kit.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)

Go to the [GOV.UK Prototype Kit site](https://govuk-prototype-kit.herokuapp.com/docs) to download the latest version and read the documentation.

#### About the Prototype Kit

The Prototype Kit provides a simple way to make interactive prototypes that look like pages on GOV.UK. These prototypes can be used to show ideas to people you work with, and to do user research.

Read the [project principles](https://govuk-prototype-kit.herokuapp.com/docs/principles).

#### Security

If you publish your prototypes online, they **must** be protected by a [username and password](https://govuk-prototype-kit.herokuapp.com/docs/publishing-on-heroku). This is to prevent members of the public finding prototypes and thinking they are real services.

You must protect user privacy at all times, even when using prototypes. Prototypes made with the kit look like GOV.UK, but do not have the same security provisions. Always make sure you are handling user data appropriately.
