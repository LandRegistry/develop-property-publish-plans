      <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Who is the list of housing developments for?</h2>
      <p>There is a need for anyone to be able to find a housing development, and to be able to see what is being developed.  Transparency.</p>
      <p>There is no specific need from a particular specialist user group to find a housing development, in the way we currently show.  We expect specialists and people buying homes to have the URL to a more specific page - the development or property they are interested in.  To have been given it, or to have found that via google.</p>
      <p>Once information is published on GOV.UK about housing development content, homes under development, and transactional services and information about developing, buying and selling, there is a need to be able to find developments and navigate between general content and specific content</p>
      <p>In the short term, it acts as a landing page for the service</p>


      <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">What does it need to do?</h2>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>Understand what this page contains</li>
        <li>where they might want to be instead</li>
        <li>where they want to go next (what do they want to do next?)</li>
        <li>quickly identify the housing development they are interested in</li>
      </ul>



      <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">What have we thought about?</h2>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>Where would this sit on gov.uk - what would link into it?</li>
        <li>what would people be searching for to find this page (key words)</li>
        <li>are developments known by more than one name (the name changes over time?)</li>
        <li>the address changes over time</li>
        <li>how might people want to search for a development in the collection - name, type, geography, by location, size, last updated, when initially published, how complete (how close to finishing)</li>
        <li>searching, filtering, ordering, pagination, ordering</li>
        <li>the list is 'active developments' - what happens when the development is finished? (is there an historical list?)</li>
        <li>publishing a data version - json or csv (or API) - for lenders?  for anyone?</li>
      </ul>
      <p></p>
      <p></p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">What are we doing now?</h2>
      <p>Set the context : say what the list is, what we are doing, how to use 'EPA' / housing services.</p>
      <p>list all developments, on one page - in alphabetical order.  So they are easy to find.</p>
