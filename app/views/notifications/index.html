      <p>These pages show how we could notify people on important events</p>

      <p>Managing by excepttion: we want to only nofity people when there is a problem - for example if a plan is incapable of registration.</p>

      <p>There are probably other important events, that should trigger a notification - that are not problems - like your plan check was successful.  Perhaps also - the plots have been surveyed.</p>

      <p>Notifications, shown here are emails, but they could be other delivery mechanisms for example an API, RSS feed, etc.
