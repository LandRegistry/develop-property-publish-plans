      <p>These prototypes show how the developer could indicate their readyness to sell - exchange, complete, transact, etc - to the buyer</p>

      <p>We think that it is useful to the developer to be able to see if there would be any problems registering this property/title before the sale/purchase transaction takes place.</p>

      <p>We think that it is useful to the purchase - buyers conveyancer (and others?) to be able to see if there would be any problems registering this property/title before the sale/purchase transaction takes place.</p>

      <!-- <p>This is about being transparent about everything we know - remove uncertainty for all interested parties - so they can make more informed decisions.</p> -->

        <p>There are other ways we could achieve these outcomes.  These prototypes are to stimulate conversation with conveyancers as to the concept and problems experienced in sales/purchases.</p>
