      <p class="govuk-body-lead">Public content about the development (estate).</p>


      <p>These pages show how we could publish all the information we know about an estate.  Where it is, who is developing it, what it consists of - plots/properties.  What 'state' those plots/properties are in...  Be as transparent as possible.</p>

      <p>Although not yet shown, we should think of these pages as being capable of showing everything government knows about the estate/plots/properties.  For example there must be a public document about planning permission.</p>

<!--       <p>These pages are created upon the first plans check.  They exist for as long as the 'thing' exsits.  So for example a plot (new title) goes on to become a property, a property/title lasts (usually) for hundreds of years.  Thus this is logically the birth of a property/new title, and goes on to become the 'page per property'/the title register.  However a develpment lasts until all the plots/properties are sold, and the remaining common areas like roads and spaces goes to the council.  So after the last plot is sold and the estate disposed of, the development page(s) no longer exist</p> -->

      <p>Here we show some of the variation of the public pages in that life cycle</p>

        <br>Being transparent means everyone can see what the current state of the plot or property is; they can choose to 'watch it' - to be notified of any change, and to be notified if there is a problem.  This one, current, view of things, replaces the multiple copies of plans and other documents that exist and the processes between parties to keep checking the state of the development before taking positive actions</p>
